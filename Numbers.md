# Goldbug 2025 – “Numbers” Puzzle Write-Up

This puzzle was part of the Crypto & Privacy Village Goldbug Challenge (DEF CON 33, 2025). It was titled **“Numbers.”**

Step 1 – Goldbug Cipher  
The puzzle started with a block of symbols (†, ‡, *, etc.), straight out of Edgar Allan Poe’s *The Gold-Bug*, which uses a substitution cipher. Decoding with the standard Goldbug substitution alphabet gave:

IF YOU ARE READING THIS YOU ALREADY KNOW THE KEY  
YOU MAY NEED TO READ MORE TO UNLOCK THE CODE  
DANA ESTES OF BOSTON MAY HELP IF YOU ARE LOST

The next stage is a **book cipher** using the **Dana Estes & Co. (Boston) edition** of *The Gold-Bug*, available on [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/goldbug00poee_0).

Step 2 – The Number Triplets  
After the cipher text came a series of number triplets, e.g.:

50-23-1 38-11-2 16-22-5 70-12-5 26-4-8 ...

These are **page–line–word coordinates** in the Estes edition. Each triplet points to a single word in the text.

Step 3 – Extracting the Words  
Extracting the words from the sequence produced:

THIRTY AND TWO  
THIRTEEN THREE  
TWENTY AND TWO  
THIRTEEN SIX  
FIFTEEN FIVE ONE

The "AND" joins digits rather than adding them:  
- `THIRTY AND TWO → 32`  
- `TWENTY AND TWO → 22`  

Condensed sequence:

32 13 3 22 13 6 15 5 1

Step 4 – From Numbers to Letters  
Using **page–line–word** again but now pulling **letters** (first letters of the words), the message emerged:

T A K E M I N E B A C K

Step 5 – Solution  
The final flag was:

TAKEMINEBACK
